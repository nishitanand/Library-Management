# Library Mangement Project
A Borland C++ OOP Based project.
It uses File handling also.
It has various books available and users can register themselves as members of the library.
It has functionalities for:
Adding, editing, deleting of book and member information
Members can issue books and the system checks if that book is available in sufficient quantity or not.
It uses File Handling to store the information even after the program ends.
Also return date is issued and if a member returns the book after it then he/she has to pay fine.
Date checking for fine without using any libraries has been done.
It uses graphics for a better console experience.
It uses password check.

May not work in Code Blocks as some libraries of Borland C++ are not available in GNU G++
